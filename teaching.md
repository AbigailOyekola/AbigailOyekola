### 📋 Teaching Contributions

#### Demonstrated Knowledge of the Field and Current Developments
- Designed and updated course syllabus for four undergraduate laboratory courses
- Integrated contemporary topics in digital logic design, energy conversion, and circuit analysis to reflect current industry practices and emerging research in programmable logic devices, microcontroller-based system design, renewable energy conversion, and sustainable power electronics
- Incorporated foundational and recent advancements in programmable logic devices, microcontroller-based system design, and renewable energy conversion into lecture supplements and laboratory exercises

#### Demonstrated Ability to Perform Continuous Program Improvement
- Revised laboratory manuals and experiment protocols for EECE 218 and EECE 326, addressing recurring conceptual gaps, improving procedural clarity, and aligning learning outcomes with ABET accreditation criteria
- Collected and analyzed student performance data across multiple semesters to identify instructional bottlenecks; restructured the sequencing of laboratory exercises to build conceptual understanding more effectively

#### Demonstrated Ability to Develop Effective Curriculum Materials
- Authored and revised laboratory manuals, pre-lab assignments, and post-lab report templates for digital systems and circuit theory courses, emphasizing hands-on implementation, systematic troubleshooting, and data-driven interpretation of experimental results
- Designed problem sets, examination questions, and project-based assignments that required students to apply theoretical principles to practical design problems, including combinational logic minimization, energy system modeling, and sensor interfacing

#### Demonstrated Ability to Organize and Effectively Present Course Work
- Delivered weekly problem-solving sessions and laboratory briefings that synthesized lecture content with experimental procedures, employing visual aids, live demonstrations, and guided problem-solving to reinforce core concepts
- Structured course content to progress from foundational theory to open-ended design challenges, culminating in capstone-style laboratory projects for senior students in EECE 326

#### Demonstrated Ability to Stimulate Student Interest
- Framed laboratory exercises within real-world engineering contexts to illustrate the relevance of foundational circuit and energy principles, including smart home automation, electric vehicle charging infrastructure, and renewable microgrids
- Facilitated interactive discussions during office hours and laboratory sessions that encouraged students to hypothesize, test assumptions, and debug their own designs independently

#### Demonstrated Ability to Contribute Generally to Student Academic Progress
- Conducted weekly office hours and supplemental tutorial sessions, providing individualized instruction to over 60 students per semester; consistently received positive feedback for clarifying complex topics and improving student confidence in experimental work
- Mentored senior undergraduate students in EECE 326 on independent research-oriented laboratory projects, guiding experimental design, data acquisition, and technical writing for final reports

#### Demonstrated Ability to Manage and Organize the Classroom Environment
- Managed laboratory sections of up to 40 students, ensuring adherence to safety protocols, equitable access to test equipment, and timely completion of experimental procedures
- Coordinated with faculty and fellow teaching assistants to standardize grading rubrics, maintain laboratory instrumentation, and ensure continuity of instruction across multiple sections

#### Demonstrated Ability to Develop and Implement Assessment Activities
- Designed and administered formative and summative assessments, including weekly laboratory quizzes, midterm practical examinations, and final design projects; employed rubric-based grading to ensure consistency and transparency
- Implemented low-stakes assessment strategies to provide real-time feedback and identify students requiring additional support, such as pre-lab readiness checks and in-lab verification questions
